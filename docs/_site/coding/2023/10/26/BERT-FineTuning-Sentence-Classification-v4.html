<h1 id="bert-fine-tuning-tutorial-with-pytorch">BERT Fine-Tuning Tutorial with PyTorch</h1>

<p>By Chris McCormick and Nick Ryan</p>

<p><em>Revised on March 20, 2020 - Switched to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenizer.encode_plus</code> and added validation loss. See <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pTuQhug6Dhl9XalKB0zUGf4FIdYFlpcX#scrollTo=IKzLS9ohzGVu">Revision History</a> at the end for details.</em></p>

<p>In this tutorial I’ll show you how to use BERT with the huggingface PyTorch library to quickly and efficiently fine-tune a model to get near state of the art performance in sentence classification. More broadly, I describe the practical application of transfer learning in NLP to create high performance models with minimal effort on a range of NLP tasks.</p>

<p>This post is presented in two forms–as a blog post <a href="http://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/">here</a> and as a Colab Notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pTuQhug6Dhl9XalKB0zUGf4FIdYFlpcX">here</a>.</p>

<p>The content is identical in both, but:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The blog post includes a comments section for discussion.</li>
  <li>The Colab Notebook will allow you to run the code and inspect it as you read through.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also published a video walkthrough of this post on my YouTube channel! <a href="https://youtu.be/x66kkDnbzi4">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Hnvb9b7a_Ps">Part 2</a>.</p>

<h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>

<p>See “Table of contents” in the sidebar to the left.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>2018 was a breakthrough year in NLP. Transfer learning, particularly models like Allen AI’s ELMO, OpenAI’s Open-GPT, and Google’s BERT allowed researchers to smash multiple benchmarks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning and provided the rest of the NLP community with pretrained models that could easily (with less data and less compute time) be fine-tuned and implemented to produce state of the art results. Unfortunately, for many starting out in NLP and even for some experienced practicioners, the theory and practical application of these powerful models is still not well understood.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-bert">What is BERT?</h2>

<p>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), released in late 2018, is the model we will use in this tutorial to provide readers with a better understanding of and practical guidance for using transfer learning models in NLP. BERT is a method of pretraining language representations that was used to create models that NLP practicioners can then download and use for free. You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce state of the art predictions.</p>

<p>This post will explain how you can modify and fine-tune BERT to create a powerful NLP model that quickly gives you state of the art results.</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-fine-tuning">Advantages of Fine-Tuning</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use BERT to train a text classifier. Specifically, we will take the pre-trained BERT model, add an untrained layer of neurons on the end, and train the new model for our classification task. Why do this rather than train a train a specific deep learning model (a CNN, BiLSTM, etc.) that is well suited for the specific NLP task you need?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quicker Development</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>First, the pre-trained BERT model weights already encode a lot of information about our language. As a result, it takes much less time to train our fine-tuned model - it is as if we have already trained the bottom layers of our network extensively and only need to gently tune them while using their output as features for our classification task. In fact, the authors recommend only 2-4 epochs of training for fine-tuning BERT on a specific NLP task (compared to the hundreds of GPU hours needed to train the original BERT model or a LSTM from scratch!).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Less Data</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>In addition and perhaps just as important, because of the pre-trained weights this method allows us to fine-tune our task on a much smaller dataset than would be required in a model that is built from scratch. A major drawback of NLP models built from scratch is that we often need a prohibitively large dataset in order to train our network to reasonable accuracy, meaning a lot of time and energy had to be put into dataset creation. By fine-tuning BERT, we are now able to get away with training a model to good performance on a much smaller amount of training data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better Results</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finally, this simple fine-tuning procedure (typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of BERT and training for a few epochs) was shown to achieve state of the art results with minimal task-specific adjustments for a wide variety of tasks: classification, language inference, semantic similarity, question answering, etc. Rather than implementing custom and sometimes-obscure architetures shown to work well on a specific task, simply fine-tuning BERT is shown to be a better (or at least equal) alternative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a-shift-in-nlp">A Shift in NLP</h3>

<p>This shift to transfer learning parallels the same shift that took place in computer vision a few years ago. Creating a good deep learning network for computer vision tasks can take millions of parameters and be very expensive to train. Researchers discovered that deep networks learn hierarchical feature representations (simple features like edges at the lowest layers with gradually more complex features at higher layers). Rather than training a new network from scratch each time, the lower layers of a trained network with generalized image features could be copied and transfered for use in another network with a different task. It soon became common practice to download a pre-trained deep network and quickly retrain it for the new task or add additional layers on top - vastly preferable to the expensive process of training a network from scratch. For many, the introduction of deep pre-trained language models in 2018 (ELMO, BERT, ULMFIT, Open-GPT, etc.) signals the same shift to transfer learning in NLP that computer vision saw.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h1 id="1-setup">1. Setup</h1>

<h2 id="11-using-colab-gpu-for-training">1.1. Using Colab GPU for Training</h2>

<p>Google Colab offers free GPUs and TPUs! Since we’ll be training a large neural network it’s best to take advantage of this (in this case we’ll attach a GPU), otherwise training will take a very long time.</p>

<p>A GPU can be added by going to the menu and selecting:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Edit 🡒 Notebook Settings 🡒 Hardware accelerator 🡒 (GPU)</code></p>

<p>Then run the following cell to confirm that the GPU is detected.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import tensorflow as tf

# Get the GPU device name.
device_name = tf.test.gpu_device_name()

# The device name should look like the following:
if device_name == '/device:GPU:0':
    print('Found GPU at: {}'.format(device_name))
else:
    raise SystemError('GPU device not found')
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Found GPU at: /device:GPU:0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order for torch to use the GPU, we need to identify and specify the GPU as the device. Later, in our training loop, we will load data onto the device.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import torch

# If there's a GPU available...
if torch.cuda.is_available():    

    # Tell PyTorch to use the GPU.    
    device = torch.device("cuda")

    print('There are %d GPU(s) available.' % torch.cuda.device_count())

    print('We will use the GPU:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))

# If not...
else:
    print('No GPU available, using the CPU instead.')
    device = torch.device("cpu")
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>There are 1 GPU(s) available.
We will use the GPU: Tesla T4
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="12-installing-the-hugging-face-library">1.2. Installing the Hugging Face Library</h2>

<p>Next, let’s install the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a> package from Hugging Face which will give us a pytorch interface for working with BERT. (This library contains interfaces for other pretrained language models like OpenAI’s GPT and GPT-2.) We’ve selected the pytorch interface because it strikes a nice balance between the high-level APIs (which are easy to use but don’t provide insight into how things work) and tensorflow code (which contains lots of details but often sidetracks us into lessons about tensorflow, when the purpose here is BERT!).</p>

<p>At the moment, the Hugging Face library seems to be the most widely accepted and powerful pytorch interface for working with BERT. In addition to supporting a variety of different pre-trained transformer models, the library also includes pre-built modifications of these models suited to your specific task. For example, in this tutorial we will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BertForSequenceClassification</code>.</p>

<p>The library also includes task-specific classes for token classification, question answering, next sentence prediciton, etc. Using these pre-built classes simplifies the process of modifying BERT for your purposes.</p>

<p>The code in this notebook is actually a simplified version of the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/run_glue.py">run_glue.py</a> example script from huggingface.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_glue.py</code> is a helpful utility which allows you to pick which GLUE benchmark task you want to run on, and which pre-trained model you want to use (you can see the list of possible models <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/e6cff60b4cbc1158fbd6e4a1c3afda8dc224f566/examples/run_glue.py#L69">here</a>). It also supports using either the CPU, a single GPU, or multiple GPUs. It even supports using 16-bit precision if you want further speed up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all of this configurability comes at the cost of <em>readability</em>. In this Notebook, we’ve simplified the code greatly and added plenty of comments to make it clear what’s going on.</p>

<h1 id="2-loading-cola-dataset">2. Loading CoLA Dataset</h1>

<p>We’ll use <a href="https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/">The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)</a> dataset for single sentence classification. It’s a set of sentences labeled as grammatically correct or incorrect. It was first published in May of 2018, and is one of the tests included in the “GLUE Benchmark” on which models like BERT are competing.</p>

<h2 id="21-download--extract">2.1. Download &amp; Extract</h2>

<p>We’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> package to download the dataset to the Colab instance’s file system.</p>

<p>We can see from the file names that both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenized</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">raw</code> versions of the data are available.</p>

<p>We can’t use the pre-tokenized version because, in order to apply the pre-trained BERT, we <em>must</em> use the tokenizer provided by the model. This is because (1) the model has a specific, fixed vocabulary and (2) the BERT tokenizer has a particular way of handling out-of-vocabulary words.</p>

<p>We’ll use pandas to parse the “in-domain” training set and look at a few of its properties and data points.</p>

<p>When we actually convert all of our sentences, we’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenize.encode</code> function to handle both steps, rather than calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenize</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convert_tokens_to_ids</code> separately.</p>

<p>Before we can do that, though, we need to talk about some of BERT’s formatting requirements.</p>

<h2 id="32-required-formatting">3.2. Required Formatting</h2>

<p>The above code left out a few required formatting steps that we’ll look at here.</p>

<p><em>Side Note: The input format to BERT seems “over-specified” to me… We are required to give it a number of pieces of information which seem redundant, or like they could easily be inferred from the data without us explicity providing it. But it is what it is, and I suspect it will make more sense once I have a deeper understanding of the BERT internals.</em></p>

<p>We are required to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add special tokens to the start and end of each sentence.</li>
  <li>Pad &amp; truncate all sentences to a single constant length.</li>
  <li>Explicitly differentiate real tokens from padding tokens with the “attention mask”.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="special-tokens">Special Tokens</h3>

<p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SEP]</code></strong></p>

<p>At the end of every sentence, we need to append the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SEP]</code> token.</p>

<p>This token is an artifact of two-sentence tasks, where BERT is given two separate sentences and asked to determine something (e.g., can the answer to the question in sentence A be found in sentence B?).</p>

<p>I am not certain yet why the token is still required when we have only single-sentence input, but it is!</p>

<p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[CLS]</code></strong></p>

<p>For classification tasks, we must prepend the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[CLS]</code> token to the beginning of every sentence.</p>

<p>This token has special significance. BERT consists of 12 Transformer layers. Each transformer takes in a list of token embeddings, and produces the same number of embeddings on the output (but with the feature values changed, of course!).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/BERT_Fine_Tuning_Sentence_Classification_v4_files/Illustration_of_CLS_token_purpose.png" alt="Illustration of CLS token purpose" /></p>

<p>On the output of the final (12th) transformer, <em>only the first embedding (corresponding to the [CLS] token) is used by the classifier</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first token of every sequence is always a special classification token (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[CLS]</code>). **The final hidden state
corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification
tasks.” (from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT paper</a>) <font color="red">Only this CLS token in latest layer is used for classifier!!!**&lt;/color&gt;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might think to try some pooling strategy over the final embeddings, but this isn’t necessary. Because BERT is trained to only use this [CLS] token for classification, we know that the model has been motivated to encode everything it needs for the classification step into that single 768-value embedding vector. It’s already done the pooling for us!</p>

<h3 id="sentence-length--attention-mask">Sentence Length &amp; Attention Mask</h3>

<p>The sentences in our dataset obviously have varying lengths, so how does BERT handle this?</p>

<p>BERT has two constraints:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All sentences must be padded or truncated to a single, fixed length.</li>
  <li>The maximum sentence length is 512 tokens.</li>
</ol>

<p>Padding is done with a special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[PAD]</code> token, which is at index 0 in the BERT vocabulary. The below illustration demonstrates padding out to a “MAX_LEN” of 8 tokens.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/BERT_Fine_Tuning_Sentence_Classification_v4_files/illustration demonstrates padding.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>The “Attention Mask” is simply an array of 1s and 0s indicating which tokens are padding and which aren’t (seems kind of redundant, doesn’t it?!). This mask tells the “Self-Attention” mechanism in BERT not to incorporate these PAD tokens into its interpretation of the sentence.</p>

<p>The maximum length does impact training and evaluation speed, however. 
For example, with a Tesla K80:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAX_LEN = 128  --&gt;  Training epochs take ~5:28 each</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAX_LEN = 64   --&gt;  Training epochs take ~2:57 each</code></p>

<h2 id="33-tokenize-dataset">3.3. Tokenize Dataset</h2>

<p>The transformers library provides a helpful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encode</code> function which will handle most of the parsing and data prep steps for us.</p>

<p>Before we are ready to encode our text, though, we need to decide on a <strong>maximum sentence length</strong> for padding / truncating to.</p>

<p>The below cell will perform one tokenization pass of the dataset in order to measure the maximum sentence length.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>max_len = 0

# For every sentence...
for sent in sentences:

    # Tokenize the text and add `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens.
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(sent, add_special_tokens=True)

    # Update the maximum sentence length.
    max_len = max(max_len, len(input_ids))

print('Max sentence length: ', max_len)
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Max sentence length:  47
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just in case there are some longer test sentences, I’ll set the maximum length to 64.</p>

<p>Now we’re ready to perform the real tokenization.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenizer.encode_plus</code> function combines multiple steps for us:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Split the sentence into tokens.</li>
  <li>Add the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[CLS]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SEP]</code> tokens.</li>
  <li>Map the tokens to their IDs.</li>
  <li>Pad or truncate all sentences to the same length.</li>
  <li>Create the attention masks which explicitly differentiate real tokens from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[PAD]</code> tokens.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first four features are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenizer.encode</code>, but I’m using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenizer.encode_plus</code> to get the fifth item (attention masks).

<h1 id="4-train-our-classification-model">4. Train Our Classification Model</h1>

<p>Now that our input data is properly formatted, it’s time to fine tune the BERT model.</p>

<h2 id="41-bertforsequenceclassification">4.1. BertForSequenceClassification</h2>

<p>For this task, we first want to modify the pre-trained BERT model to give outputs for classification, and then we want to continue training the model on our dataset until that the entire model, end-to-end, is well-suited for our task.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the huggingface pytorch implementation includes a set of interfaces designed for a variety of NLP tasks. Though these interfaces are all built on top of a trained BERT model, each has different top layers and output types designed to accomodate their specific NLP task.</p>

<p>Here is the current list of classes provided for fine-tuning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BertModel</li>
  <li>BertForPreTraining</li>
  <li>BertForMaskedLM</li>
  <li>BertForNextSentencePrediction</li>
  <li><strong>BertForSequenceClassification</strong> - The one we’ll use.</li>
  <li>BertForTokenClassification</li>
  <li>BertForQuestionAnswering</li>
</ul>

<p>The documentation for these can be found under <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.2.0/model_doc/bert.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll be using <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.2.0/model_doc/bert.html#bertforsequenceclassification">BertForSequenceClassification</a>. This is the normal BERT model with an added single linear layer on top for classification that we will use as a sentence classifier. As we feed input data, the entire pre-trained BERT model and the additional untrained classification layer is trained on our specific task.</p>

<p>OK, let’s load BERT! There are a few different pre-trained BERT models available. “bert-base-uncased” means the version that has only lowercase letters (“uncased”) and is the smaller version of the two (“base” vs “large”).</p>

Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

<h2 id="42-optimizer--learning-rate-scheduler">4.2. Optimizer &amp; Learning Rate Scheduler</h2>

<p>Now that we have our model loaded we need to grab the training hyperparameters from within the stored model.</p>

<p>For the purposes of fine-tuning, the authors recommend choosing from the following values (from Appendix A.3 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT paper</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Batch size:</strong> 16, 32</li>
    <li><strong>Learning rate (Adam):</strong> 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5</li>
    <li><strong>Number of epochs:</strong> 2, 3, 4</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>We chose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Batch size: 32 (set when creating our DataLoaders)</li>
  <li>Learning rate: 2e-5</li>
  <li>Epochs: 4 (we’ll see that this is probably too many…)</li>
</ul>

<p>The epsilon parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eps = 1e-8</code> is “a very small number to prevent any division by zero in the implementation” (from <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/">here</a>).</p>

<p>You can find the creation of the AdamW optimizer in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_glue.py</code> <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/5bfcd0485ece086ebcbed2d008813037968a9e58/examples/run_glue.py#L109">here</a>.</p>

<p>Below is our training loop. There’s a lot going on, but fundamentally for each pass in our loop we have a trianing phase and a validation phase.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Thank you to <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/stasbekman">Stas Bekman</a> for contributing the insights and code for using validation loss to detect over-fitting!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Unpack our data inputs and labels</li>
  <li>Load data onto the GPU for acceleration</li>
  <li>Clear out the gradients calculated in the previous pass.
    <ul>
      <li>In pytorch the gradients accumulate by default (useful for things like RNNs) unless you explicitly clear them out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Forward pass (feed input data through the network)</li>
  <li>Backward pass (backpropagation)</li>
  <li>Tell the network to update parameters with optimizer.step()</li>
  <li>Track variables for monitoring progress</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evalution:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Unpack our data inputs and labels</li>
  <li>Load data onto the GPU for acceleration</li>
  <li>Forward pass (feed input data through the network)</li>
  <li>Compute loss on our validation data and track variables for monitoring progress</li>
</ul>

<p>Pytorch hides all of the detailed calculations from us, but we’ve commented the code to point out which of the above steps are happening on each line.</p>

  <p><em>PyTorch also has some <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py">beginner tutorials</a> which you may also find helpful.</em></p>

<p>Notice that, while the the training loss is going down with each epoch, the validation loss is increasing! This suggests that we are training our model too long, and it’s over-fitting on the training data.</p>

<p>(For reference, we are using 7,695 training samples and 856 validation samples).</p>

<p>Validation Loss is a more precise measure than accuracy, because with accuracy we don’t care about the exact output value, but just which side of a threshold it falls on.</p>

<p>If we are predicting the correct answer, but with less confidence, then validation loss will catch this, while accuracy will not.</p>

<p>Cool! In about half an hour and without doing any hyperparameter tuning (adjusting the learning rate, epochs, batch size, ADAM properties, etc.) we are able to get a good score.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note: To maximize the score, we should remove the “validation set” (which we used to help determine how many epochs to train for) and train on the entire training set.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The library documents the expected accuracy for this benchmark <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/examples.html#glue">here</a> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">49.23</code>.</p>

<p>You can also look at the official leaderboard <a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/submission/zlssuBTm5XRs0aSKbFYGVIVdvbj1/-LhijX9VVmvJcvzKymxy">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that (due to the small dataset size?) the accuracy can vary significantly between runs.</p>

<h2 id="a2-weight-decay">A.2. Weight Decay</h2>

<p>The huggingface example includes the following code block for enabling weight decay, but the default decay rate is “0.0”, so I moved this to the appendix.</p>

<p>This block essentially tells the optimizer to not apply weight decay to the bias terms (e.g., $ b $ in the equation $ y = Wx + b $ ). Weight decay is a form of regularization–after calculating the gradients, we multiply them by, e.g., 0.99.</p>

<h1 id="revision-history">Revision History</h1>

<p><strong>Version 4</strong> - <em>Feb 2nd, 2020</em> - (current)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated all calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">model</code> (fine-tuning and evaluation) to use the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/output.html#transformers.modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SequenceClassifierOutput</code></a> class.</li>
  <li>Moved illustration images to Google Drive–Colab appears to no longer support images at external URLs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 3</strong> - <em>Mar 18th, 2020</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplified the tokenization and input formatting (for both training and test) by leveraging the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenizer.encode_plus</code> function. 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encode_plus</code> handles padding <em>and</em> creates the attention masks for us.</li>
  <li>Improved explanation of attention masks.</li>
  <li>Switched to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.utils.data.random_split</code> for creating the training-validation split.</li>
  <li>Added a summary table of the training statistics (validation loss, time per epoch, etc.).</li>
  <li>Added validation loss to the learning curve plot, so we can see if we’re overfitting.
    <ul>
      <li>Thank you to <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/stasbekman">Stas Bekman</a> for contributing this!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Displayed the per-batch MCC as a bar plot.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 2</strong> - <em>Dec 20th, 2019</em> - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y4o3jh3ZH70tl6mCd76vz_IxX23biCPP">link</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>huggingface renamed their library to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transformers</code>.</li>
  <li>Updated the notebook to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transformers</code> library.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Version 1</strong> - <em>July 22nd, 2019</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial version.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="further-work">Further Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It might make more sense to use the MCC score for “validation accuracy”, but I’ve left it out so as not to have to explain it earlier in the Notebook.</li>
  <li>Seeding – I’m not convinced that setting the seed values at the beginning of the training loop is actually creating reproducible results…</li>
  <li>The MCC score seems to vary substantially across different runs. It would be interesting to run this example a number of times and show the variance.</li>
</ul>
